Reflection
- The making of this project was absolutely long and tedious, as I am sure many of my classmates would say, but truly one of the most rewarding experiences in the vast realm all school projects. Personally, there are 3 reasons why this project takes on a truly special position in my heart. 
    1. This was a coding breakthrough for me - Throughout the two months or so that we have worked on this, despite the fact that I mostly used previous knowledge to construct this project, I now have grasped a deep and powerful understanding of everything implemented in this game I have created. It has touched nearly all elements in the CS30 curriculum. Previously, I had the knowledge of coding theory but little chance to experience the concepts. Currently, that is no longer an issue and I am confident in my ability to flexibly use the concepts that I have used here with ease in the future. 
    2. It increased my love for computer science - The unfortunate fact is that I do not have a brain wired for the realm of computer science. Quite in fact, I registered for CS20 a week before the beginning of class with the mindset of "filling a spare." All to say, I struggled a lot with that course and this one, but I had also been enamoured with the subject since my entry to it. This was my first huge project, and I do not know why it is what it is, but after this experience, I know for a fact that my liking to computer science is now a passionate love and I hope to be able to code for the rest of my life, even if I do not study it in the future.
