Beta Testing (01/22/23)

My Mom:
    No advice. Every functional game was playable and made sense to her easily. She did suggest improving the visuals


My Cousin (Coding Experience):
    Believed that game was quite functional. Suggested using objects for chess game instead of functions. 

What I did with their advice: 
    Took it, turned functions into objects in chess game. Unfortunately was unable to find time for html and css designs generally speaking (done most of chess's). Chess is also incomplete and I believe that more simplifying could be done with it.
